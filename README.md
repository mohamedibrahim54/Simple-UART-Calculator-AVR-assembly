# Simple-UART-Calculator-AVR-assembly
Simple AVR Calculator implemented in AVR Assembly which Communicate through UART to get calculation operands and send back the result.

it's challenging project. I have challenged my self to make AVR assembly project.
I have learned alot from this project like:
-	Learning alot about Microcontroller Architecture.
-	Initialize stack pointer and stack management (push and pop data from stack in context switch).
-	Write data manipulation functions ( itoa & atoi ) in assembly.
-	Do comparisons, loops and branching.
-	passing parameters to function.
-	Handle UART ISR 

The program has around 280 Instructions. 
note: the project was create in 2018 and it's archieved NOW.
